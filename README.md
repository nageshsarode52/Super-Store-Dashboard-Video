# Super-Store-Dashboard-Video
# Introduction
In this project, the goal was to analyze the profit and loss of a Super Store using PowerBI. The project involved a comprehensive data analysis process, starting from data cleaning to building a final interactive dashboard for better insights. The analysis was conducted on the store's sales, inventory, and profit/loss data to provide valuable insights into the store's financial performance.

To present the results effectively, a video walkthrough has been created, showcasing key features of the analysis and providing a better understanding of the final dashboard.
